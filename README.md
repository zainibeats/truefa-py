# TrueFA-Py - Secure TOTP Authenticator

TrueFA-Py is a secure, offline Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) application built with Python and Rust. It provides a robust command-line interface for managing TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password) authentication codes while keeping your security tokens encrypted and stored locally in a secure vault.

## Installation & Usage

### Windows

#### Prerequisites
- **Visual C++ Redistributable 2015-2022** - Required for the Rust cryptography module
  - Download from [Microsoft](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe)
  - This is required for both the portable executable and installed versions

#### From Source (Current Method)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/zainibeats/truefa-py.git && cd truefa-py
python -m venv venv && .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

#### Building the Application (Coming Soon)
```bash
# Build the portable executable
python dev-tools\build_package.py --portable

# Or build with installer
python dev-tools\build_package.py --installer
```

### Docker

#### Quick Run (Non-Persistent)
```bash
# Basic run with temporary volumes (PowerShell)
.\docker\run_docker.ps1
```

#### Persistent Storage Run
```bash
# Run with persistent vault data and local images folder (PowerShell)
.\docker\run_docker_persistent.ps1
```

#### Manual Configuration
```bash
# Build the Docker image
docker build -t truefa-py -f docker/Dockerfile .

# Run with persistent storage
docker run -it --rm \
  -v "truefa-vault:/home/truefa/.truefa" \
  -v "./images:/app/images" \
  -e "TRUEFA_USE_FALLBACK=1" \
  -e "TRUEFA_PORTABLE=1" \
  truefa-py
```

**Notes for Docker Usage:**
- The `/app/images` directory in the container is mapped to a local `images` folder
- Place your QR code images in the local `images` folder
- Vault data is stored in a Docker volume for persistence

## Cross-Platform Compatibility

TrueFA-Py is designed with robust cross-platform compatibility:

- **Rust Cryptography Module**: Provides high-performance, memory-safe cryptographic operations on Windows
- **Python Fallback Implementation**: Automatically activates when the Rust module cannot be loaded
- **Intelligent Detection**: Seamlessly switches between implementations based on your environment

This dual-implementation approach ensures the application works flawlessly across different systems and environments.

- [Developer Guide](docs/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md) - Development setup, testing, and technical details
- [Documentation Index](docs/README.md) - Overview of all available documentation

## Basic Usage

```bash
python main.py
```

This will start the command-line interface with the following options:
1. Load QR code from image
2. Enter secret key manually
3. Save current secret
4. View saved secrets
5. Export secrets
6. Clear screen
7. Exit

## Security Architecture

TrueFA-Py uses a hybrid approach with a Rust cryptography module for performance and security, with a Python fallback implementation. The secure vault employs envelope encryption:

1. **Vault Password** - Unlocks the vault and decrypts the master key
2. **Master Key** - Encrypts/decrypts individual TOTP secrets

Key security features include:
- Memory protection with automatic zeroing of sensitive data
- AES-256-CBC authenticated encryption
- Session state management to minimize password entry
- Envelope encryption to protect master keys and individual secrets
