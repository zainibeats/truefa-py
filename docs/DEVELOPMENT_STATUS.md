# TrueFA-Py Development Status

## Project Status

### Recent Improvements
We've made significant progress on the TrueFA-Py application:

- **✅ Fixed QR Code Scanning**: Resolved path validation issues when loading QR codes from images
- **✅ Enhanced Vault Security**: Added password protection for viewing secret names and implemented password caching
- **✅ Improved Encryption/Decryption**: Implemented robust AES-256-CBC with proper padding and key handling
- **✅ Better Error Handling**: Added comprehensive error handling and debug logging
- **✅ Rust Integration**: Updated DLL loading mechanism with proper fallback to Python implementations
- **✅ Persisting Vault Unlocked State**: Implemented session state tracking to maintain vault unlocked status between operations
- **✅ JSON Serialization for Bytes**: Fixed issues with saving secret bytes data in JSON-compatible format
- **✅ Vault Security Robustness**: Ensured the vault remains secure across sessions with proper session state management

### Current Focus
Our primary goal is completing the Rust cryptography integration. The application is fully functional, command-line based with no GUI components.

## Outstanding Issues and Next Steps

### Remaining Issues
1. **Rust Cryptography Integration**: While the DLL loading mechanism works, there are still issues with some function signatures not being found in the DLL.
2. **Permission Issues in AppData**: Some users may experience permission issues with the default secure storage locations, though fallback paths are working correctly.

### Next Steps

1. **Complete Rust Integration**:
   - Fix the `create_secure_string` function export in the Rust DLL
   - Ensure all Rust functions are properly exported with the correct signatures
   - Test encryption/decryption using Rust functions with full integration

2. **Comprehensive Testing**:
   - Test on various Windows versions
   - Verify all features work as expected
   - Create test cases for error conditions

3. **Build Executable**:
   - Create a standalone executable using PyInstaller
   - Test the executable across different Windows environments

4. **Docker Container Testing**:
   - Test in Windows Docker containers
   - Verify functionality with various Python versions and environments

## Implementation Details

### Fixed Issues

#### QR Code Scanning
- Fixed path validation in the `_validate_image_path` method to properly handle file paths
- Added better error handling to prevent NoneType errors
- Improved path resolution for relative paths

#### Vault Security
- Enhanced vault unlocking mechanism to require master password before viewing secret names
- Implemented password caching to minimize repeated password prompts
- Fixed issues with vault state management to maintain unlock state

#### Encryption/Decryption
- Improved AES-256-CBC implementation with proper padding and IV generation
- Enhanced key derivation and management
- Fixed inconsistencies in data format between encryption and decryption

#### Session State Management
- Implemented a persistent session state dictionary to track the vault's unlock status
- Added caching of the master password to avoid repeated prompts within a session
- Ensured the session state is maintained even when the underlying vault object state changes

#### Secret Storage
- Fixed JSON serialization issues for bytes objects in secret data
- Implemented proper encoding/decoding of binary data for storage and retrieval
- Added comprehensive error handling for data conversion edge cases

### Testing Instructions

1. **Basic Functionality Test**:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
   - Choose option 1 to load a QR code from image
   - Enter the path to a QR code image (e.g., "qrtest.png")
   - Verify that TOTP codes are generated correctly

2. **Vault Operations Test**:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
   - Load a QR code (option 1)
   - Save the secret (option 3)
   - View the saved secrets (option 4)
   - Verify that secrets are properly encrypted and decrypted

3. **Rust Integration Test**:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
   - Check the debug output for messages about DLL loading
   - Verify that Rust crypto functions are used when available
   - Ensure fallback to Python implementations works correctly when needed
