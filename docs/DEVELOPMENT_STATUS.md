# TrueFA-Py Development Status

This document tracks the current state of the TrueFA-Py project, highlighting recent improvements and remaining issues.

## Recent Improvements

- **✅ Fixed QR Code Scanning**: Resolved path validation issues when loading QR codes from images
- **✅ Enhanced Vault Security**: Added password protection for viewing secret names and implemented password caching
- **✅ Improved Encryption/Decryption**: Implemented robust AES-256-CBC with proper padding and key handling
- **✅ Better Error Handling**: Added comprehensive error handling and debug logging
- **✅ Rust Integration**: Fixed DLL loading mechanism with proper function signatures and robust error handling
- **✅ Persisting Vault Unlocked State**: Implemented session state tracking to maintain vault unlocked status
- **✅ JSON Serialization for Bytes**: Fixed issues with saving secret bytes data in JSON-compatible format
- **✅ Vault Security Robustness**: Ensured the vault remains secure across sessions with proper session state management
- **✅ Fixed Rust SecureString Creation**: Implemented proper function export in the Rust DLL
- **✅ Added Crypto Verification Tool**: Created comprehensive testing for all Rust crypto functions
- **✅ Auto-Rebuild Capability**: Added functionality to automatically rebuild the Rust DLL if loading fails
- **✅ Rust Key Derivation**: Fixed key derivation to properly handle byte-based salt values

## Current State

The application is now fully functional with a complete Rust cryptography integration. Core functionality is stable and the command-line interface provides a complete TOTP authentication solution.

## Outstanding Issues

1. **Permission Issues in AppData**: Some users may experience permission issues with the default secure storage locations, though fallback paths are working correctly.

## Next Steps

1. **Build Executable**:
   - Create a standalone executable using PyInstaller
   - Test the executable across different Windows environments

2. **Docker Container Testing**:
   - Test in Windows Docker containers
   - Verify functionality with various Python versions and environments

## Technical Details

### Rust Cryptography Integration
- Fixed the `create_secure_string` function export in the Rust DLL to properly handle input data
- Added proper function signatures for all Rust functions in the Python loader
- Implemented automatic DLL rebuilding if loading fails
- Added comprehensive error handling and debugging for DLL loading issues
- Created a verification tool to test all Rust crypto functions
- Fixed key derivation to properly handle byte-based salt values

### Vault Security
- Enhanced vault unlocking mechanism to require master password before viewing secret names
- Implemented password caching to minimize repeated password prompts
- Fixed issues with vault state management to maintain unlock state
