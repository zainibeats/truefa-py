    Secure String Implementation for Sensitive Data Protection
    
    Provides memory-safe storage for sensitive string data like passwords and
    cryptographic keys. Implements automatic memory sanitization and protection
    against common memory disclosure vulnerabilities.
    
    Key Security Features:
    - Uses platform-specific secure memory allocations when available
    - Prevents memory swapping to disk
    - Implements automatic zeroization when no longer needed
    - Tracks creation time for automatic expiration
    - Provides context manager interface for controlled access
    
    This implementation uses the Rust-based secure memory module when available,
    with a fallback to a Python-based implementation with best-effort memory
    protection.
