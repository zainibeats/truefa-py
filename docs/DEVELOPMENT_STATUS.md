# TrueFA-Py Development Status

## Current Status

TrueFA-Py has reached a stable state with both CLI and GUI interfaces. The application provides secure TOTP authentication with a focus on security and usability.

### Recent Updates

#### GUI Implementation
- Added a complete PyQt6-based GUI interface
- Implemented secure vault integration with the GUI
- Added account management features (add, delete, import, export)
- Implemented QR code scanning for adding accounts
- Added dark mode support and modern styling

#### Security Enhancements
- Improved vault encryption with AES-GCM
- Added secure memory handling for sensitive data
- Implemented two-layer security architecture
- Added support for secure import/export

#### Core Functionality
- Improved TOTP token generation and validation
- Enhanced QR code scanning capabilities
- Added support for various token formats and parameters
- Implemented robust error handling and validation

## Roadmap

### Short-term Goals
- Enhance GUI with additional features (search, sorting, categories)
- Improve QR code scanning with camera support in the GUI
- Add backup and restore functionality
- Implement cloud sync options (with end-to-end encryption)

### Medium-term Goals
- Add support for HOTP and other authentication methods
- Implement push notification support
- Add biometric authentication for vault unlocking
- Create mobile companion apps

### Long-term Vision
- Develop a cross-platform ecosystem with shared secure storage
- Implement advanced security features (hardware token support, etc.)
- Add enterprise features for team management
- Develop a plugin system for extensibility
- Mobile Applications

## Contributing

We welcome contributions to TrueFA-Py! Please see the [Developer Guide](DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md) for information on how to get started.

## Outstanding Issues

1. **Windows Container OpenCV Support**: Windows Docker containers cannot properly support OpenCV installation, limiting QR code testing in these environments.

2. **GUI Import/Python Path Issues**: The GUI application has some import path issues that need to be resolved for proper integration with the existing codebase.
