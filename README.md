## Technical Architecture

### Hybrid Crypto Implementation
TrueFA-Py uses a hybrid approach to cryptographic operations:

1. **Primary: Rust Native Module**
   - High-performance, memory-safe cryptographic operations
   - Bindings to Python via FFI (Foreign Function Interface)
   - Secure memory management techniques
   - Optimized for desktop environments
   - Redesigned `c_generate_salt` function that avoids GIL issues
   - Timeout protection for all cryptographic functions

2. **Fallback: Pure Python Implementation**
   - Automatic fallback when native module is unavailable or encounters issues
   - Compatible with all platforms
   - Maintains security principles while sacrificing some performance
   - Ensures application functionality in all environments
   - Automatically activated if Rust functions time out or return errors

### Vault Implementation
The secure vault uses a two-layer security model:
1. **Vault Password** - Unlocks the vault and decrypts the master key
2. **Master Key** - Encrypts/decrypts individual TOTP secrets

This envelope encryption approach ensures that even if one layer is compromised, your secrets remain protected by the other layer.

## User Guide

For complete usage instructions, please refer to the [User Guide](docs/USER_GUIDE.md). Below is a quick overview:

### First-Time Setup
1. Launch TrueFA-Py using the provided launcher script
2. When prompted, create a strong master password
3. This password will be required for all future access to your vault

### Adding Accounts
1. Select option 1 or 2 from the main menu to add an account
   - Option 1: Load QR code from image
   - Option 2: Enter secret key manually
2. Follow the prompts to enter account details
3. Use option 3 to save the account to your secure vault

### Viewing Accounts and Codes
1. Select option 4 from the main menu
2. Enter your master password when prompted
3. Choose from the list of available accounts
4. The current TOTP code will be displayed

### Managing Accounts
- Use option 5 to export your secrets
- Use option 6 to clear the screen
- Use option 7 to exit the application

## Installation

### Portable Version
1. Download the latest release package
2. Extract to your preferred location
3. Run `TrueFA-Py-Launcher.bat` to start the application

The application will store its data in the `.truefa` directory in your user folder, or in the application directory if running in portable mode.

### Installer Version
Run `TrueFA-Py_Setup.exe` and follow the installation wizard. This will:
- Install TrueFA-Py to the Program Files directory
- Create start menu shortcuts
- Add an uninstaller
- Register the application with Windows

## Testing in Docker

We've included a Docker-based testing environment to help diagnose issues in a clean Windows installation:

```batch
# Run the Docker test script
.\dev-tools\docker\test_docker.bat
```

This creates a `truefa-py-docker-test` image and runs a container that tests the application in a clean Windows environment.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. Check the `.truefa` directory in your user home folder for marker files (like `.dll_crash`) that indicate specific issues.
2. Ensure the application has permission to write to your home directory.
3. Try running with administrator privileges if you encounter permission errors.
4. Delete the `.truefa` directory to reset the application state if needed.
5. Use the latest version of the application which includes the optimized Rust implementation with proper timeout protection.
6. If the application appears to hang, try setting the `TRUEFA_USE_FALLBACK=1` environment variable to force using the Python implementation.
7. For detailed troubleshooting steps, refer to the [FAQ](docs/FAQ.md) document.
