# TrueFA-Py Development Status

This document tracks the current state of the TrueFA-Py project and remaining issues.

## Current State

TrueFA-Py is now a fully functional TOTP authenticator with complete Rust cryptography integration and standardized encrypted import/export functionality. The application provides a comprehensive CLI interface for managing 2FA secrets with robust security measures.

Key components include:
- Secure vault with two-layer encryption
- QR code scanning for TOTP secret import
- Import/export system with multiple format support
- Cross-platform compatibility with fallback mechanisms

## Outstanding Issues

1. **OpenCV in Portable Version**: QR code scanning functionality requires OpenCV dependencies, which aren't bundled with the portable executable. This remains a limitation for testing QR functionality in containerized environments.

2. **Windows Container OpenCV Support**: Windows Docker containers cannot properly support OpenCV installation, limiting QR code testing in these environments.

## Recently Completed Milestones

### Import/Export System
- Implemented secure export of TOTP secrets with AES-256 encryption
- Created standard encrypted JSON format for interoperability with other authenticator apps
- Added OTPAuth URI display for easy copying to other applications
- Implemented format auto-detection for seamless import experience
- Enhanced security with PBKDF2 key derivation and proper error handling

### Standardized Logging System
- Unified logging with flexible configuration and multiple output channels
- Added support for four logging modes with independent console/file controls
- Implemented structured logging with context-rich output format

## Technical Details

### Import/Export Implementation
- Uses AES-256 encryption in CBC mode for secure file exports
- Provides OTPAuth URI display for direct copying to other authenticator apps
- Implements PBKDF2 key derivation with strong iteration count
- Features intelligent path handling and format detection
- Includes comprehensive validation for security and reliability

### Vault Security
- Requires master password verification before accessing secrets
- Implements password caching to minimize repeated password prompts
- Features deep verification of vault unlock state with fail-secure defaults
- Provides envelope encryption to protect master keys and individual secrets
