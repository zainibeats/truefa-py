# TrueFA-Py Development Status

## Project Status

### Recent Improvements
We've made significant progress on the TrueFA-Py application:

- **✅ Fixed QR Code Scanning**: Resolved path validation issues when loading QR codes from images
- **✅ Enhanced Vault Security**: Added password protection for viewing secret names and implemented password caching
- **✅ Improved Encryption/Decryption**: Implemented robust AES-256-CBC with proper padding and key handling
- **✅ Better Error Handling**: Added comprehensive error handling and debug logging
- **✅ Rust Integration**: Updated DLL loading mechanism with proper fallback to Python implementations

### Current Focus
Our primary goal is achieving a fully functional application with seamless Rust cryptography integration. The application is command-line based with no GUI components.

## Outstanding Issues and Next Steps

### Remaining Issues
1. **Rust Cryptography Integration**: While we've improved the DLL loading mechanism, we need to ensure the Rust crypto functions are properly called and integrated.
2. **Error Handling Edge Cases**: Some error handling cases need further testing with various input types.
3. **Vault Security Robustness**: Ensure the vault remains secure across sessions and with various password combinations.

### Next Steps

1. **Complete Rust Integration**:
   - Verify all Rust functions are properly exported and accessible
   - Test encryption/decryption using Rust functions
   - Ensure proper fallback to Python implementations when needed

2. **Comprehensive Testing**:
   - Test on various Windows versions
   - Verify all features work as expected
   - Create test cases for error conditions

3. **Build Executable**:
   - Create a standalone executable using PyInstaller
   - Test the executable across different Windows environments

4. **Docker Container Testing**:
   - Test in Windows Docker containers
   - Verify functionality with various Python versions and environments

## Implementation Details

### Fixed Issues

#### QR Code Scanning
- Fixed path validation in the `_validate_image_path` method to properly handle file paths
- Added better error handling to prevent NoneType errors
- Improved path resolution for relative paths

#### Vault Security
- Enhanced vault unlocking mechanism to require master password before viewing secret names
- Implemented password caching to minimize repeated password prompts
- Fixed issues with vault state management to maintain unlock state

#### Encryption/Decryption
- Improved AES-256-CBC implementation with proper padding and IV generation
- Enhanced key derivation and management
- Fixed inconsistencies in data format between encryption and decryption

### Testing Instructions

1. **Basic Functionality Test**:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
   - Choose option 1 to load a QR code from image
   - Enter the path to a QR code image (e.g., "qrtest.png")
   - Verify that TOTP codes are generated correctly

2. **Vault Operations Test**:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
   - Load a QR code (option 1)
   - Save the secret (option 3)
   - View the saved secrets (option 4)
   - Verify that secrets are properly encrypted and decrypted

3. **Rust Integration Test**:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
   - Check the debug output for messages about DLL loading
   - Verify that Rust crypto functions are used when available
   - Ensure fallback to Python implementations works correctly when needed
