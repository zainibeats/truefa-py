# TrueFA-Py Development Status

This document tracks the current state of the TrueFA-Py project and remaining issues

## Current State

The application is now fully functional with a complete Rust cryptography integration. Core functionality is stable and the command-line interface provides a complete TOTP authentication solution.

The project has reached a significant milestone with both portable executable and installer packages successfully built and verified. Docker container testing confirms cross-environment compatibility with the application functioning correctly in clean Windows environments.

## Outstanding Issues

1. **OpenCV in Portable Version**: QR code scanning functionality requires OpenCV dependencies. The portable executable itself doesn't bundle OpenCV, and we currently have challenges with OpenCV support in the Windows Docker container. This remains a limitation for testing the QR code functionality in containerized environments.

2. **Windows Container OpenCV Support**: The Windows Docker container currently cannot support OpenCV installation, which limits the ability to test QR code scanning functionality in containerized Windows environments. Users testing in Windows containers will not be able to use QR code scanning features.

## Completed Milestones

1. **Rust Cryptography Integration**:
   - Successfully fixed `c_create_secure_string` function and properly exported it in the DLL
   - Implemented intelligent fallback mechanism for cryptography operations
   - Added comprehensive verification tools for testing cryptography functions

2. **Build System**:
   - Created and validated both portable executable and installer packages
   - Implemented flexible build options with PowerShell scripts
   - Added Docker-based testing environment for cross-environment validation

3. **Docker Container Testing**:
   - Successfully tested both portable executable and installer in Windows Docker containers
   - Verified vault persistence across application restarts
   - Confirmed correct behavior with protected storage locations

4. **Standardized Logging System**:
   - Implemented Python's built-in logging module with flexible configuration
   - Added independent control of console and file logging levels
   - Created support for four distinct logging modes (normal, debug, no-log, debug+no-log)
   - Added detailed log formatting with timestamps, source files, and line numbers
   - Ensured backward compatibility with existing debug print statements

## Technical Details

### Rust Cryptography Integration
- Fixed the `create_secure_string` function export in the Rust DLL to properly handle input data
- Added proper function signatures for all Rust functions in the Python loader
- Implemented automatic DLL rebuilding if loading fails
- Added comprehensive error handling and debugging for DLL loading issues
- Created a verification tool to test all Rust crypto functions
- Fixed key derivation to properly handle byte-based salt values

### Logging System
- Replaced custom debug print implementation with standard Python logging
- Added command-line flags for independent control of console and file logging
- Implemented four logging modes to suit different usage scenarios:
  - Regular mode: Warnings in console, all levels in file log
  - Debug mode: All debug messages in console and file log
  - No-log mode: Only warnings in console with no file logging
  - Debug without logging: Debug messages in console without file logging
- Added detailed log formatting with timestamps, source files, and line numbers
- Ensured backward compatibility through a debug_print wrapper function
- Created centralized logger configuration system for consistent logging across modules
- Log files are stored in `~/.truefa/logs/` with timestamp-based naming

### Vault Security
- Enhanced vault unlocking mechanism to require master password before viewing secret names
- Implemented password caching to minimize repeated password prompts
- Fixed issues with vault state management to maintain unlock state

### Installation and Distribution
- Successfully packaged both portable executable and installer versions
- Confirmed correct operation of the installer with proper file placement
- Validated that the Rust DLL is correctly loaded in both portable and installed versions
- Verified that vault persistence works correctly across application sessions
