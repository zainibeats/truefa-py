# TrueFA-Py Development Status

This document tracks the current state of the TrueFA-Py project and remaining issues

## Current State

The application is now fully functional with a complete Rust cryptography integration. Core functionality is stable and the command-line interface provides a complete TOTP authentication solution.

The project has reached a significant milestone with both portable executable and installer packages successfully built and verified. Docker container testing confirms cross-environment compatibility with the application functioning correctly in clean Windows environments.

## Outstanding Issues

1. **OpenCV in Portable Version**: QR code scanning functionality requires OpenCV dependencies. While the portable executable itself doesn't bundle OpenCV, we've added Python and OpenCV to the Windows Docker container to support scanning of static QR code images. This enables testing of the full QR code functionality from image files without requiring a physical camera.

## Completed Milestones

1. **Rust Cryptography Integration**:
   - Successfully fixed `c_create_secure_string` function and properly exported it in the DLL
   - Implemented intelligent fallback mechanism for cryptography operations
   - Added comprehensive verification tools for testing cryptography functions

2. **Build System**:
   - Created and validated both portable executable and installer packages
   - Implemented flexible build options with PowerShell scripts
   - Added Docker-based testing environment for cross-environment validation

3. **Docker Container Testing**:
   - Successfully tested both portable executable and installer in Windows Docker containers
   - Verified vault persistence across application restarts
   - Confirmed correct behavior with protected storage locations

## Technical Details

### Rust Cryptography Integration
- Fixed the `create_secure_string` function export in the Rust DLL to properly handle input data
- Added proper function signatures for all Rust functions in the Python loader
- Implemented automatic DLL rebuilding if loading fails
- Added comprehensive error handling and debugging for DLL loading issues
- Created a verification tool to test all Rust crypto functions
- Fixed key derivation to properly handle byte-based salt values

For detailed information about the security implementation, please refer to the [Security Documentation](SECURITY.md).

### Vault Security
- Enhanced vault unlocking mechanism to require master password before viewing secret names
- Implemented password caching to minimize repeated password prompts
- Fixed issues with vault state management to maintain unlock state

### Installation and Distribution
- Successfully packaged both portable executable and installer versions
- Confirmed correct operation of the installer with proper file placement
- Validated that the Rust DLL is correctly loaded in both portable and installed versions
- Verified that vault persistence works correctly across application sessions
