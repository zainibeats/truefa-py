# TrueFA-Py Development Status

## Current Status

TrueFA-Py has reached a stable state with both CLI and GUI interfaces. The application provides secure TOTP authentication with a focus on security and usability.

### Recent Updates

#### GUI Implementation
- Added a complete PyQt6-based GUI interface
- Implemented secure vault integration with the GUI
- Added account management features (add, delete, import, export)
- Implemented QR code scanning for adding accounts
- Added dark mode support and modern styling

#### Security Enhancements
- Improved vault encryption with AES-GCM
- Added secure memory handling for sensitive data
- Implemented two-layer security architecture
- Added support for secure import/export

#### Core Functionality
- Improved TOTP token generation and validation
- Enhanced QR code scanning capabilities
- Added support for various token formats and parameters
- Implemented robust error handling and validation

## Roadmap

### Short-term Goals
- Enhance GUI with additional features (search, sorting, categories)
- Improve QR code scanning with camera support in the GUI
- Add backup and restore functionality
- Implement cloud sync options (with end-to-end encryption)

### Medium-term Goals
- Add support for HOTP and other authentication methods
- Implement push notification support
- Add biometric authentication for vault unlocking
- Create mobile companion apps

### Long-term Vision
- Develop a cross-platform ecosystem with shared secure storage
- Implement advanced security features (hardware token support, etc.)
- Add enterprise features for team management
- Develop a plugin system for extensibility

## Contributing

We welcome contributions to TrueFA-Py! Please see the [Developer Guide](DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md) for information on how to get started.

Key components include:
- Secure vault with two-layer encryption
- QR code scanning for TOTP secret import
- Import/export system with multiple format support
- Cross-platform compatibility with fallback mechanisms
- Docker deployment with persistent storage and secure exports
- Modern GUI interface with dark mode support

## Outstanding Issues

1. **OpenCV in Portable Version**: QR code scanning functionality requires OpenCV dependencies, which aren't bundled with the portable executable. This remains a limitation for testing QR functionality in containerized environments.

2. **Windows Container OpenCV Support**: Windows Docker containers cannot properly support OpenCV installation, limiting QR code testing in these environments.

3. **GUI Import/Python Path Issues**: The GUI application has some import path issues that need to be resolved for proper integration with the existing codebase.

## Recently Completed Milestones

### PyQt6 GUI Implementation
- Created a modern, user-friendly GUI with PyQt6
- Implemented vault login and management screens
- Added visual TOTP token display with countdown timer
- Designed account management system for stored secrets
- Integrated QR code scanning for adding accounts
- Implemented secure import/export functionality
- Added dark mode with persistent settings
- Created a comprehensive stylesheet for consistent design

### Docker Containerization
- Enhanced Docker implementation with proper persistent storage mapping
- Fixed export path handling to correctly use configured export directories
- Implemented environment variable prioritization for vault location
- Improved security of exported files by ensuring consistent directory structure 
- Added proper fallback mechanisms for cross-platform compatibility

### Import/Export System
- Implemented secure export of TOTP secrets with AES-256 encryption
- Created standard encrypted JSON format for interoperability with other authenticator apps
- Added OTPAuth URI display for easy copying to other applications
- Enhanced path handling with proper defaults and environment variable support

### Standardized Logging System
- Unified logging with flexible configuration and multiple output channels
- Added support for four logging modes with independent console/file controls
- Implemented structured logging with context-rich output format

## Technical Details

### GUI Implementation
- Built with PyQt6 for cross-platform compatibility
- Modular design with separate components for different functionalities
- Secure handling of sensitive information with secure text fields
- Integration with existing vault and TOTP generation systems
- Comprehensive error handling and user feedback
- Persistent settings for user preferences

### Import/Export Implementation
- Uses AES-256 encryption in CBC mode for secure file exports
- Provides OTPAuth URI display for direct copying to other authenticator apps
- Implements PBKDF2 key derivation with strong iteration count
- Features intelligent path handling and format detection
- Includes comprehensive validation for security and reliability

### Vault Security
- Requires master password verification before accessing secrets
- Implements password caching to minimize repeated password prompts
- Features deep verification of vault unlock state with fail-secure defaults
- Provides envelope encryption to protect master keys and individual secrets
